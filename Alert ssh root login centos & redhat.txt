1. Login in the server as the root user. Ensure that you have already configured the lcoal yum repository.
yum repolist

2. Install sendmail & mailx packages from local yum repository in your machine.
yum install -y mailx sendmail 

3. Start the sendmail service and also enable it.
systemctl start sendmail
systemctl enable sendmail

4. Now go to home directory of root user & longlist the contents of it including hidden files.
cd
ls -al

5. Here you will see a .bashrc profile file, open it in vi editor and paste the line mentioned below there.
vim .bashrc

echo ' ALERT - Root Shell Access on:'  `date` `who` | mail -s " Alert: SSH Root Access"  system@triangle.com.bd  #ikbal.hossain@triangle.com.bd

echo ' ALERT - Root Shell Access 192.168.1.107 on:'  `date` `who` | mail -s " Alert: Root Access"   er.vikasnehra@yahoo.com

Here replace the email address and ip address with your own email address and your machine ip address/hostname.
Better to use yahoo mail because other gmail and other mail services sometimes cause problems.  

6. Now SSH into your machine from to test whether you receive the alert email in your inbox or not.

7. Open your mailbox & check in spam folder, you will see the Login Alert Emails there.
